### Overview
This project focuses on creating a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) dashboard for managing customer data. The dashboard is built entirely using HTML and CSS, without the use of any JavaScript logic. The layout has been intelligently resized to adapt to mobile view, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices.

### Key Features
- **Pure HTML and CSS**: The project demonstrates proficiency in creating dynamic layouts and styling using only HTML and CSS.
- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard is designed to be responsive, providing optimal viewing and interaction experience across a range of devices.
- **Icon Handling**: Icons have been integrated using the `mask` property, ensuring consistent and visually appealing representation throughout the dashboard.

### Future Enhancements

### Note
While the project currently doesn't incorporate dropdown mechanics, it remains open for further enhancements to enrich the user experience.
